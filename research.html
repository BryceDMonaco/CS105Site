<h2>Notebook Check #2:</h2>
Since we were required to write a one page essay for each article for notebook check #2, I have created a table of each article I found in one column with each article's respective essay in the column next to it. Each article's link is to a PDF copy of that respective article.

<table>

<h2>Notebook Check #1:</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/young_lawyers/publications/tyl/topics/poplaw/will_virtual_reality_transform_realworld_laws/">"Will Virtual Reality Transform Real-World Laws?"</a></h3> 
A PDF version of this article can be found <a href="files/news/vrlaws.pdf"> here</a>.

<p>
This article discusses potential legal impacts of virtual reality (VR) becoming increasingly popular. I think the impacts discussed by this article will affect me because I develop for VR and use it recreationally to play a few games. VR is a technology that is new and exciting, and I do my best to keep up with it. At least for the next few years, I do not expect a major impact on me or others, simply because VR is still treated as a "wild west" of sorts where everyone is constantly experimenting. The article discusses potential legal ramifications/punishments for something such as punching another player in VR. I think that this idea is absurd, if a user puts on some sort of device/equipment that allows them to feel pain from VR, they are likely aware of the potential for pain and, by using such a device, likely agree to not hold anyone liable for harm. I think the only real point the author of this article brings up is the use of trademarked material for characters in-game. This is a legal impact that exists right now and can simply be handled as any other trademark violation would. I can prepare myself for the impact of this issue by paying attention to assets I use in any sort of development for VR, being sure to avoid or get a licsense to use trademarked material, additionally I can take the time to be aware of potential risks I will take when I interact in VR.

<h3><a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/riverbed-app-data-privacy-0220">"Putting Data Privacy in the Hands of Users"</a></h3> 
A PDF version of this article can be found <a href="files/news/privacy.pdf"> here</a>.

<p>
This article discusses a solution to combat against the increasing loss of indiividual privacy in today's online world. With data leaks becoming very common, it is the users', and therefore my, best interest to find solutions to make up for loss of privacy. The solution proposed is a system called "Riverbed" in which users can specify their own rules for how their data is used, and servers are required to follow those rules. A tool such as this has a very high positive impact on me and could change how I browse the internet. I am always concerned with how my data is handled by companies and having the ability to explicitly control how it is used is something I would very much like. As a computer science student, I can prepare for this by supporting this platform or similar platforms. My system using this platform creates trust between me and my users and shows that I am working in their best interests, not mine. As a consumer, I can prepare for this by using it in my normal online activities. By using this tool, it encourages development and support for it, increasing my privacy online.

<h3><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190128111718.htm">"Converting Wi-Fi Signals to Electricity With New 2D Materials"</a></h3> 
A PDF version of this article can be found <a href="files/news/wifipower.pdf"> here</a>.

<p>
This article presents a new device which can convert wifi signals into DC voltage. The goal of this device, and devices like this, is to eventually replace batteries in low power devices, especially medical devices, to mititgate battery-related risks. I think this will affect me by expanding the possibilities for wireless power for devices. Currently, the device shown in the article is meant for small devices, but the authors propose a future where we have smart devices which power themselves just off of wifi signals, which are everywhere in our modern world. I think this will contribute to ending needing to charge battery-powered devices, instead, simply being somewhere where wifi signals are found will keep my devices charged. I can prepare for this by continuing to use wifi, therefore increasing the ubiquity of wifi signals. I can also support devices which utilize other forms of wireless power/charging such as modern phones which support wireless charging through induction.

<h3><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/opinion/internet-facebook-google-consent.html">"How Silicon Valley Puts the ‘Con’ in Consent"</a></h3> 
A PDF version of this article can be found <a href="files/news/consent.pdf"> here</a>.

<p>
This article discusses the state of privacy in our data-heavy world. It brings up predatory usage tracking apps from Facebook and Google and also brought up the point that most people do not read any terms and conditions documents but are surprised when they find out what they agreed to give access to. I think this will and does affect me because I have to agree to many terms and conditions documents in order to continue using tools and services which I enjoy. Some may say that because I enjoy the service I should be alright with the loss of privacy, but being aware of what I am giving away makes me uncomfortable. This will continue to affect me because companies are becoming more and more greedy with data, which means we are continuing to lose our privacy. Giants such as Google and Facebook are to the point of offering money to people as young as thirteen, who do not understand privacy. I can resist this issue by avoiding using products by Facebook, Google, and other tech companies where their primary product is their users' data. Unfortunately, many of these companies are massive and others collect data in secret/without informing you, making it extremely difficult to avoid.

<h3><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/big-data-streaming/">"Best-Ever Algorithm Found for Huge Streams of Data"</a></h3> 
A PDF version of this article can be found <a href="files/news/datastream.pdf"> here</a>.

<p>
This article presents a solution which the creators are calling the best-ever for handling huge streams of data. Data can be streamed from a massive amount of sources, and all of these streams use a massive amount of bandwidth and computational power to process it all. Processing data is hard simply because of the sheer volume of it, and this solution utilizes trend spotting and strategic forgetting to maximize efficiency. I think the algorithm shown in the article will affect me because I may work in a position where I must process data from a large "fire hose" and will need a way to do it efficiently. I think that companies which are in the business of data, and the article "How Silicon Valley Puts the 'Con' in Consent" shows that ther are many, will use this algorithm to improve their data processing. I can prepare myself for the solution discussed in this article by using the algorithm in any tools where I need to process large amounts of data.
