This article discusses potential legal impacts of virtual reality (VR) becoming increasingly popular. I think the impacts discussed by this article will affect me because I develop for VR and use it recreationally to play a few games. VR is a technology that is new and exciting, and I do my best to keep up with it. At least for the next few years, I do not expect a major impact on me or others, simply because VR is still treated as a "wild west" of sorts where everyone is constantly experimenting. The article discusses potential legal ramifications/punishments for something such as punching another player in VR. I think that this idea is absurd, if a user puts on some sort of device/equipment that allows them to feel pain from VR, they are likely aware of the potential for pain and, by using such a device, likely agree to not hold anyone liable for harm. I think the only real point the author of this article brings up is the use of trademarked material for characters in-game. This is a legal impact that exists right now and can simply be handled as any other trademark violation would. I can prepare myself for the impact of this issue by paying attention to assets I use in any sort of development for VR, being sure to avoid or get a licsense to use trademarked material, additionally I can take the time to be aware of potential risks I will take when I interact in VR.
