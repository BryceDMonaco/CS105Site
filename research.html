This article discusses potential legal impacts of virtual reality (VR) becoming increasingly popular. I think the impacts discussed by this article will affect me because I develop for VR and use it recreationally to play a few games. VR is a technology that is new and exciting, and I do my best to keep up with it. At least for the next few years, I do not expect a major impact on me or others, simply because VR is still treated as a "wild west" of sorts where everyone is constantly experimenting. The article discusses potential legal ramifications/punishments for something such as punching another player in VR. I think that this idea is absurd, if a user puts on some sort of device/equipment that allows them to feel pain from VR, they are likely aware of the potential for pain and, by using such a device, likely agree to not hold anyone liable for harm. I think the only real point the author of this article brings up is the use of trademarked material for characters in-game. This is a legal impact that exists right now and can simply be handled as any other trademark violation would. I can prepare myself for the impact of this issue by paying attention to assets I use in any sort of development for VR, being sure to avoid or get a licsense to use trademarked material, additionally I can take the time to be aware of potential risks I will take when I interact in VR.

<p>
This article discusses a solution to combat against the increasing loss of indiividual privacy in today's online world. With data leaks becoming very common, it is the users', and therefore my, best interest to find solutions to make up for loss of privacy. The solution proposed is a system called "Riverbed" in which users can specify their own rules for how their data is used, and servers are required to follow those rules. A tool such as this has a very high positive impact on me and could change how I browse the internet. I am always concerned with how my data is handled by companies and having the ability to explicitly control how it is used is something I would very much like. As a computer science student, I can prepare for this by supporting this platform or similar platforms. My system using this platform creates trust between me and my users and shows that I am working in their best interests, not mine. As a consumer, I can prepare for this by using it in my normal online activities. By using this tool, it encourages development and support for it, increasing my privacy online.
