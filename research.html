<h3><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190416145213.htm">"A Novel Data-Compression Technique for Faster Computer Programs"</a></h3> 
A PDF version of this article can be found <a href="files/news/compress.pdf"> here</a>.

<p>
This article presented a new data-compression technique developed by researchers at MIT which works by compressing objects in memory. When compared to traditional cache-based compression methods, it compressed nearly twice as much and reduced memory usage by 50%. This is useful in any computer system because it significantly increases the amount of free memory available. I think this will affect me because I use computer systems in almost every aspect of my life every day. I think this will affect me by speeding up my work on computers and allowing me to run multiple programs or to run single programs faster, because they can run longer before needing to wait for memory to free up. I can prepare myself for the impact of this issue by adopting technologies which utilize this new technique and by potentially developing with this technique in mind to help it spread.

<h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/8/18300734/microsoft-safely-remove-eject-usb-flash-drive-not-needed-windows-10">"Microsoft Confirms You Really, Really Don’t Need to ‘Safely Remove’ USB Flash Drives Anymore"</a></h3> 
A PDF version of this article can be found <a href="files/news/eject.pdf"> here</a>.

<p>
This article discusses a new feature released in the latest Windows 10 version which results in users no longer needing to worry about ejecting their flash drives or othe USB storage devices before they physically unplug them from the computer. It is done by disabling a cache technique which is used to speed up file transfers, but has the added drawback of needing to eject the flash drive (to make sure their is no data left in the cache, which would cause corruption). I think this will affect me slightly because I still occasionally use USB flash drives to transfer data between machines when an over-the-air or over the internet method is not available. I expect this to affect me by slightly reducing file transfer speeds, but by also speeding up my workflow because I no longer need to worry about going through the process of ejecting a device. I can embrace this by continuing to use my flash drives when I need them and by updating to the latest version of Windows 10.

<h3><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/cloud-database-removed-after-exposing-details-on-80-million-us-households/">"Cloud Database Removed after Exposing Details on 80 Million Us Households"</a></h3> 
A PDF version of this article can be found <a href="files/news/breach.pdf"> here</a>.

<p>
This article discussed a recently breached and exposed database which held information on over 80 million US households. The database consisted of inforamtion such as addresses, income, and even marital statuses. As far as I can tell, no private information such as credit cards or social security numbers were leaked. I think this affects me because I am certain that my information is stored in at least one, but most likely tens if not hundreds of different databases held by different people and companies. While I do not think this specific database will affect me severely, I do think that I will be affected by other breached or exposed databases because so many companies care very little about the privacy and security of their users. I expect this to affect me by leading to more database breaches in the future which result in my information being leaked to those who I do not want to have access to it normally. I can avoid this by not using the internet, which is unrealistic given how prevalent it is in our modern society, so I can only accept that breaches will happen and I will need to keep an eye out for things which could be affected by them.

<h3><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/facebook-we-stored-millions-of-instagram-passwords-in-plain-text">"Facebook Stored Millions of Instagram Passwords in Plain Text"</a></h3> 
A PDF version of this article can be found <a href="files/news/plaintext.pdf"> here</a>.

<p>
This article discusses Facebook admitting to storing a significant amount of user passwords in plain text, this means the passwords were not encrypted and could be simply viewed by anyone. It originally admitted to only tens of thousands of accounts being affected, but later corrected that to millions of accounts, which is incredibly alarming. This is another example of companies simply not caring about the security of their users and instead opting to go the lazy and cheap way and simply store passwords as normal text. I think this will affect me because I have an Instagram account, and it has a password which I use on some accounts on other websites. I think this will affect me by people potentially seeing my password at the time of the breach. I can prepare myself for the impact of this issue by changing my password for Instagram and changing my password for other accounts which use the same username, email, and/or password.

<h3><a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/young_lawyers/publications/tyl/topics/poplaw/will_virtual_reality_transform_realworld_laws/">"Will Virtual Reality Transform Real-World Laws?"</a></h3> 
A PDF version of this article can be found <a href="files/news/vrlaws.pdf"> here</a>.

<p>
This article discusses potential legal impacts of virtual reality (VR) becoming increasingly popular. I think the impacts discussed by this article will affect me because I develop for VR and use it recreationally to play a few games. VR is a technology that is new and exciting, and I do my best to keep up with it. At least for the next few years, I do not expect a major impact on me or others, simply because VR is still treated as a "wild west" of sorts where everyone is constantly experimenting. The article discusses potential legal ramifications/punishments for something such as punching another player in VR. I think that this idea is absurd, if a user puts on some sort of device/equipment that allows them to feel pain from VR, they are likely aware of the potential for pain and, by using such a device, likely agree to not hold anyone liable for harm. I think the only real point the author of this article brings up is the use of trademarked material for characters in-game. This is a legal impact that exists right now and can simply be handled as any other trademark violation would. I can prepare myself for the impact of this issue by paying attention to assets I use in any sort of development for VR, being sure to avoid or get a licsense to use trademarked material, additionally I can take the time to be aware of potential risks I will take when I interact in VR.

<h3><a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/riverbed-app-data-privacy-0220">"Putting Data Privacy in the Hands of Users"</a></h3> 
A PDF version of this article can be found <a href="files/news/privacy.pdf"> here</a>.

<p>
This article discusses a solution to combat against the increasing loss of indiividual privacy in today's online world. With data leaks becoming very common, it is the users', and therefore my, best interest to find solutions to make up for loss of privacy. The solution proposed is a system called "Riverbed" in which users can specify their own rules for how their data is used, and servers are required to follow those rules. A tool such as this has a very high positive impact on me and could change how I browse the internet. I am always concerned with how my data is handled by companies and having the ability to explicitly control how it is used is something I would very much like. As a computer science student, I can prepare for this by supporting this platform or similar platforms. My system using this platform creates trust between me and my users and shows that I am working in their best interests, not mine. As a consumer, I can prepare for this by using it in my normal online activities. By using this tool, it encourages development and support for it, increasing my privacy online.

<h3><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190128111718.htm">"Converting Wi-Fi Signals to Electricity With New 2D Materials"</a></h3> 
A PDF version of this article can be found <a href="files/news/wifipower.pdf"> here</a>.

<p>
This article presents a new device which can convert wifi signals into DC voltage. The goal of this device, and devices like this, is to eventually replace batteries in low power devices, especially medical devices, to mititgate battery-related risks. I think this will affect me by expanding the possibilities for wireless power for devices. Currently, the device shown in the article is meant for small devices, but the authors propose a future where we have smart devices which power themselves just off of wifi signals, which are everywhere in our modern world. I think this will contribute to ending needing to charge battery-powered devices, instead, simply being somewhere where wifi signals are found will keep my devices charged. I can prepare for this by continuing to use wifi, therefore increasing the ubiquity of wifi signals. I can also support devices which utilize other forms of wireless power/charging such as modern phones which support wireless charging through induction.

<h3><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/opinion/internet-facebook-google-consent.html">"How Silicon Valley Puts the ‘Con’ in Consent"</a></h3> 
A PDF version of this article can be found <a href="files/news/consent.pdf"> here</a>.

<p>
This article discusses the state of privacy in our data-heavy world. It brings up predatory usage tracking apps from Facebook and Google and also brought up the point that most people do not read any terms and conditions documents but are surprised when they find out what they agreed to give access to. I think this will and does affect me because I have to agree to many terms and conditions documents in order to continue using tools and services which I enjoy. Some may say that because I enjoy the service I should be alright with the loss of privacy, but being aware of what I am giving away makes me uncomfortable. This will continue to affect me because companies are becoming more and more greedy with data, which means we are continuing to lose our privacy. Giants such as Google and Facebook are to the point of offering money to people as young as thirteen, who do not understand privacy. I can resist this issue by avoiding using products by Facebook, Google, and other tech companies where their primary product is their users' data. Unfortunately, many of these companies are massive and others collect data in secret/without informing you, making it extremely difficult to avoid.

<h3><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/big-data-streaming/">"Best-Ever Algorithm Found for Huge Streams of Data"</a></h3> 
A PDF version of this article can be found <a href="files/news/datastream.pdf"> here</a>.

<p>
This article presents a solution which the creators are calling the best-ever for handling huge streams of data. Data can be streamed from a massive amount of sources, and all of these streams use a massive amount of bandwidth and computational power to process it all. Processing data is hard simply because of the sheer volume of it, and this solution utilizes trend spotting and strategic forgetting to maximize efficiency. I think the algorithm shown in the article will affect me because I may work in a position where I must process data from a large "fire hose" and will need a way to do it efficiently. I think that companies which are in the business of data, and the article "How Silicon Valley Puts the 'Con' in Consent" shows that ther are many, will use this algorithm to improve their data processing. I can prepare myself for the solution discussed in this article by using the algorithm in any tools where I need to process large amounts of data.
