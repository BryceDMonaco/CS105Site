<p>This semester has been very interesting to me and I think I have learned something new, even as a graduating computer science student. Much of the information was review, but I really appreciated having it brought up again because I use so much of it on a daily basis that I had forgotten the history behind most of it. I will always love converting between the various number bases (for example. octal, hex, decimal, and binary) and really enjoyed that portion of the class, the information on how media is stored was also very cool, and the history of computer science is always something I appreciate. I don't think there were any topics that I was not interested in, and I appreciated the overview of everything. I think the number bases will by far be the most useful for my future, since I use them almost every day at work and used them all the time in classes which went into embedded systems. I also thought most of the labs were very interesting and fun, even if I was able to go through most of them with relative ease. I think they would be fantastic for someone just starting in computer science.</p>
